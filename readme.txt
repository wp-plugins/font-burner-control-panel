The Font Burner Plugin allows you to easily add Font Burner Fonts to your Wordpress theme. (IF UPGRADING, BE SURE TO RECORD YOUR FONT BURNER SETTINGS BEFORE YOU UPGRADE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE LOST.)

== Description ==
Typography on the web is very limiting. Luckily you have options when it comes to improving the fonts on your site. The Font Burner Control Panel plugin allows you to easily add any of the 1000+ free fonts available on the <a href="http://www.fontburner.com/the-font-burner-wordpress-plugin/">Font Burner website</a> to your Wordpress theme. Simply find a font you like and type it's name into this plugin and your headlines will instantly be transformed! You don't need to know how to use sifr, you don't have to customize your theme. You don't need Flash. Font Burner is the easiest way to bring rich typography into your Wordpress theme.
